I started my Software Engineering journey 1 year ago when I joined Amazon. And the journey till now has been really awesome.
Oh, did I say I&#x27;m also a State-level Athletic player with 100m Race &amp; Shot Put as my favorite sport?
I started Youtube Channel to help the student community by sharing my knowledge regarding Job Preparation, Personal growth &amp; other aspects of College Life.
Social Media is much more than numbers, and I really love playing with algorithms, creating value-adding content &amp; designing proper platform &amp; niche-based strategies.
How can I help you?
For College Students You can follow me on LinkedIn or other Social Media Platforms for diversified content aiming at increasing knowledge &amp; awareness.
Can be fun sometimes, If I am able to crack good joke through my storytelling :P
Brands/ Influencers, I can help you create awesome content and grow organically through marketing strategy and planning over social media.
Drop a text or feel free to connect at anshikagpt97@gmail.com.
Would be happy to respond!
